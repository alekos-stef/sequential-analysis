# sequential_analysis
R scripts for the dissertation "Sequential Analysis Models and Applications", written by Alexandros Stefanidis in 2015, at the University of Piraeus.
The folder includes methods of sequential estimation (sequential interval estimation), sequential hypothesis testing for normal distributions, estimation of the Average Sample Number (ASN) and the Operating Characteristic (OC) functions, estimation of the ARL function of the CUSUM algorithm by using various approximations. All the data were generated by Monte Carlo simulations.
You can find the details and the math behind the methods, by looking either at my thesis (in English here at this folder -> look at the pdf file) or at the book "Sequential Methods and Their Applications" by N.Mukhopadhyay.
